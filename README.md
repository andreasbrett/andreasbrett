### ![Who Am I?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbrett/andreasbrett/master/assets/whoami.png)

### Hey there, it's Andreas here
I'm a child of the 80s, born into tech. My parents were both in information technology, so my path was already paved. I first got in touch with programming in school with `Pascal` and `Basic`, ventured over `C++`, `Java` and some functional languages (which shall not be named... 🧙) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). I created quick-and-dirty bash, cmd, and PowerShell scripts while working in IT operations and dipped my toes into VB.NET for library development. I had a passion for web development back when it was still done in a plain old text editor and uploaded via SFTP...

In my free time, I mostly experiment with `JavaScript`, `Python`, and `PowerShell`.

- 🏠 I love fiddling with smart home tech (mainly [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) and [ZigBee](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt))
- ❤️ I enjoy photography 📸 and love capturing the amazing landscapes and views this 🌍 has to offer
- ❤️ I crave music 🎧 and love noodling on my guitars 🎸 to relieve daily stress 😵

### The numbers...
I'm only here on GitHub for personal projects and stuff I contribute to. So please don't expect anything special... 🦄
