### ![Who Am I?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbrett/andreasbrett/master/assets/whoami.png)

### Hey there, it's Andreas here
I'm a kid of the 80s and born into tech. Being raised by parents both in information technology my path had already been paved. Started my dev experiences back in school with `Pascal` and `Basic`, ventured over `C++`, `Java` and some functional languages (who shall not be named... 🧙) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). Created quick-n-dirty `bash`/`cmd`/`powershell` scripts when working in IT ops and dipped my toes into `VB.NET` for lib development. Had a thing for web dev back when it still was working in a plain old text editor and uploading via SFTP... 

For fun and apart from work I'm mostly hacking `Javascript`, `Python` and `Powershell` into [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) or the like.

- 🏠 I love fiddling with smart home tech (mainly [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) and [ZigBee](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt))
- ❤️ I enjoy photography 📸 and being out capturing those amazing landscapes and sceneries this 🌍 has to offer
- ❤️ I crave for music 🎧 and love noodling away daily stress 😵 on my guitars 🎸

### The numbers...
I'm only here on GitHub for personal projects and stuff I contribute to. So please don't expect anything special... 🦄
